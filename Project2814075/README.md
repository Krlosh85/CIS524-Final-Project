# Description

In this coding assignment I compared two different programming languages by implementing a well known search algorithm: Binary Search!
This is a good example because it can be used to compare how does each language implements the following fundamentals in any programming languages:
1. Recursion / Iteration
2. Memory Management (static vs dynamic allocation in our case)
3. Parameter Passing Methods (as seen in class)
4. Data Structure implementation (since they are mathematically the same structures, the syntax is the one that changes, while semantics stay the same)

# Requirements/Commands

## C Compiler
```bash
c++ BSearch.c -o BSearch
```
``` bash
./BSearch
```

## Python Compiler
```bash
python (or py) BSearch.py
```

# Explanation/Comparison
## Binary Search
### Def.
It is a search algorithm used to find the position and the value of a given value within a **SORTED** array/list of numbers. It can be implemented with iterations and with recursion. 

*** Using Iteration ***
Time Complexity: 
    Best Case: O(1)
    Average Case: O(log N)
    Worst Case: O(log N)

*** Using Recursion ***
Time Complexity: O(log N)


## Main Differences
### Concept #1: Readability
| Python | C |
| --- | --- |
| List all new or modified files |
| Show file differences that haven't been staged |
### Concept #2: 

| Python | C |
| --- | --- |
| List all new or modified files |
| Show file differences that haven't been staged |

### Concept #3: 

| Python | C |
| --- | --- |
| List all new or modified files |
| Show file differences that haven't been staged |

### Concept #4:

| Python | C |
| --- | --- |
| List all new or modified files |
| Show file differences that haven't been staged |
